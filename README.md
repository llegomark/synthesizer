# Synthesizer Gradio App

This repository contains the source code for a Text-to-Speech (TTS) web application powered by OpenAI's text-to-speech API and Gradio. The application is designed to convert user-input text into spoken audio using a selection of AI-generated voices.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose between standard and high-definition TTS models for different use cases.
- **Voice Options**: Select from six distinct AI-generated voices to read your text.
- **Output Format Selection**: Customize the output format to suit your needs, including "mp3", "opus", "aac", or "flac".
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Gradio for an intuitive and straightforward user experience.
- **Deployed on HuggingFace Spaces**: Accessible online for easy interaction and demonstration.
